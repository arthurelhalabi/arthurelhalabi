Hi, I’m Arthur El Halabi
I’m interested in joining the dev market, specifically Back-end.
I’m currently working on some projects of my own, with JavaScript, Node.js and Python. I am familiar with Bash, Docker and mongDB. 
I’m looking to collaborate on pilot projects to improve my knowledge and challenges, why?! What would a dev be without a good challenge. 

Little of me...
At the moment I am studying at the Faculty of Software Engineering, 
I have some short course certifications. Approximately 2 years Working on personal projects.

Currently my native language is Portuguese-BR, and I scratch at English. 

My desire is to learn and work with the bast, regardless of the language or challenge, I will always be willing.
